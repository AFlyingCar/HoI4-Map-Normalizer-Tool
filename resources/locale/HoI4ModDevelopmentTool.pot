"Province maps are 24-bit RGB bitmaps which describe the positions of every "

"dimensions, the HoI4 engine cannot. Additionally, HoI4 does not allow "
"province maps with a pixel area exceeding 13'107'200.\n"
"\n"
"When loading these maps in this tool, we will detect each province in the "
"input image, and only require that they be all separated by a boundary of "
"pixels made of the RGB color value (0,0,0). Additionally, for automated "
"detection of province types (LAND, SEA, LAKE), you can color in the provinces "
"with a solid color to denote which one is which. This will allow the tool to "
"fill in this information about each province automatically, choose unique "
"random colors from appropriate color pools (all automatically chosen SEA "
"tiles will get blue-ish colors, for example), as well as determine other "
"information automatically, such as whether a given province is a coastal tile "
